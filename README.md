# IoT-TempMonitor
An embedded platform IoT Temperature monitor for a Leopard Gecko enclosure, fulfilling hot- and cold-end requirements in the temperature gradient. Built in Keil Studio for the ARM platform NUCLEO-L432KC.

Written in C++ using the Keil Studio online mbed os platform for arm.

Code can be proven ineffective, but temperature detection and warning LED's performed well enough during calibration. There are some errors.

A write-up of the actual functionality will be added in Finnish.

Part of the HAMK IoT Curriculum in the spring of 2023.
